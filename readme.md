All xml, and some images created by Steve Boswell (ChoccyHobNob).

Based on the "Eudora" theme by AmadhiX, which is in turn based on the "Carbon" theme by Eric Hettervik, which is in turn based on "Simple" by Nils Bonenberger.  Most system logos and line art images are borrowed from these themes.

The following fonts are used under the licenses included with the font files:
